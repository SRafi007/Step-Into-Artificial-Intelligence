# Artificial Intelligence Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

### What is Artificial Intelligence?
- **Definition**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
- **Core Aim**: Creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- **Key Capabilities**: Problem-solving, learning, reasoning, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.

### Historical Development of AI
- **1950s**: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test; term "Artificial Intelligence" coined at Dartmouth Conference (1956).
- **1960s-70s**: Development of early expert systems and symbolic AI.
- **1980s**: Rise and fall of expert systems ("AI Winter").
- **1990s-2000s**: Machine learning gains prominence.
- **2010s-Present**: Deep learning revolution, large language models, and significant advances in practical applications.

## Types of AI

### Based on Capabilities
1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**
   - Designed for specific tasks (e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation systems)
   - Cannot perform beyond its programmed parameters
   - Examples: Siri, Alexa, chess programs

2. **General AI (Strong AI)**
   - Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence across domains
   - Ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different tasks
   - Currently does not exist in practical form

3. **Superintelligence**
   - Theoretical AI that surpasses human intelligence
   - Subject of philosophical and safety discussions

### Based on Functionality
1. **Reactive Machines**
   - No memory or past experience utilization
   - Example: IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer)

2. **Limited Memory**
   - Uses past experiences to inform future decisions
   - Examples: Self-driving cars, recommendation systems

3. **Theory of Mind**
   - Understanding beliefs, intentions, and emotions
   - Still largely theoretical in complete form

4. **Self-Aware AI**
   - Possessing consciousness and understanding of self
   - Purely theoretical concept

## Core AI Approaches and Techniques

### Symbolic AI
- Based on symbolic representation of knowledge
- Uses logic and rule-based systems
- Strong in explicit reasoning tasks
- Limitations in handling uncertainty and learning from data

### Machine Learning
- **Definition**: Systems that learn patterns from data without explicit programming
- **Key Types**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data (inputs paired with desired outputs)
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial-and-error with rewards/penalties

### Deep Learning
- Subset of machine learning using artificial neural networks
- Multiple layers of processing to learn representations
- Key architectures:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - Primarily for image processing
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** - For sequential data
  - **Transformers** - For natural language processing and beyond

## AI Ethics and Societal Impact

### Ethical Concerns
- **Bias and Fairness**: AI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases
- **Privacy**: Data collection and surveillance concerns
- **Transparency**: "Black box" problem of understanding AI decisions
- **Accountability**: Who is responsible for AI actions?
- **Job Displacement**: Economic impacts of automation

### AI Safety
- **Alignment Problem**: Ensuring AI systems act according to human values
- **Control Problem**: Maintaining human control over increasingly complex systems
- **Unintended Consequences**: Difficulty predicting all outcomes of advanced systems

### Governance Approaches
- Regulatory frameworks
- Industry standards and best practices
- Ethics boards and committees
- International cooperation

## Current Frontiers and Future Directions
